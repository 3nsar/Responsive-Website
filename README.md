For this website I was inspired by a youtube video from a channel for front-end designs.
In this video the youtuber build a hole website.
My goal was, to make a similair website, but without watching the video.
I used for this website just pure Html and Css. 
I also worked a lot with media-queries and with flexbox.
This website helped me, to repeat some important HTML/CSS technics
