For this website I was inspired by a youtube-video about front-end designs.
In this video the youtuber build a website, but without functions.
My goal was, to make a similair website, but without watching the video.
I used for this website just pure Html and Css. 
I also worked a lot with media-queries and with flexbox.
This website doesnt't have any special functions, because i wanted just to practice some important HTML/CSS technics
